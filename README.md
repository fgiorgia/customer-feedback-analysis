I used a dataset collected from a project for the Introduction to Data Analytics Course 2023 for the [ReDI School of Digital Integration Malmö](https://www.redi-school.org/redi-school-malmo). Submitted by - Giorgia Faedda.

## Assignment instruction
You are working for a small startup that sells natural beauty products. The company recently conducted a customer feedback survey to understand how their customers feel about their products and services. Your task is to analyze the data collected from the survey and provide insights to the company.

### Data Description
The survey collected responses from 71 customers. The data is stored in two text files named customer_feedback_1.txt and customer_feedback_2.txt - Note that the two files contain almost the same set of data, but with some discrepancies.

### Variables
The files contain the following columns:
- **customer_id**: Unique ID assigned to each customer
- **age**: Age of the customer
- **gender**: Gender of the customer (M or F)
- **product_rating**: Rating of the product on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest)
- **service_rating**: Rating of the customer service on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest)
- **recommend**: Whether the customer would recommend the company to others (Yes or No)
- **feedback**: Open-ended feedback provided by the customer

### Tasks
- Load the data from the text files to Excel. 
- Clean and manipulate the data if necessary (e.g., remove duplicates, handle missing values, etc.).
- Explore the data using descriptive statistics and visualizations. 
  - Consider the following questions:
    1. What is the age distribution of the customers?

    2. Are there any recurring issues or complaints?
    3. Based on your analysis, provide recommendations to the company on how they can improve their products and services.

### Submission
Create a sheet in your Excel file with the name “Analysis”. Here you should include both the answers to the questions and  comments explaining your thought process and conclusions.
